The files in this folder continue the exploration of object oriented programming using a rectangle.

0. Simple Rectangle - An empty class that defines an instance of a rectangle (0-rectangle.py).
1. Real Definition of a Rectangle - Rectangle class that defines an instance of a rectangle by width and height (1-rectangle.py).
2. Area and Perimeter - Rectangle class defined by width and height, and calculates the area and perimeter (2-rectangle.py).
3. String Representation - Rectangle class defined by width and height, calculates area and perimeter, and prints it to the screen using '#' (3-rectangle.py).
4. Eval is Magic - Rectangle class (same as 3-rectangle.py), using repr() to return the string rectangle and creating new instances using eval().(4-rectangle.py)
5. Detect Instance Deletion - Rectangle class (same as 4-rectangle.py) that prints a message when an instance of Rectangle is deleted.
6. How Many Instances - Rectangle class that defines an instance of a rectangle
